## 4. Feature Engineering Strategy

### 4.1 Time-Based Feature Engineering

#### **Time Since Signup Features**
```python
# Key Features Created:
- time_since_signup_hours: Hours between signup and purchase
- signup_hour: Hour of day when user signed up
- signup_day: Day of week when user signed up
- purchase_hour: Hour of day for transaction
- purchase_day: Day of week for transaction
- time_diff_hours: Time difference in hours
```

#### **Rationale for Time Features**
1. **New Account Risk**: Fresh accounts are prime targets for fraud
2. **Temporal Patterns**: Fraud follows specific time patterns
3. **Behavioral Anomalies**: Unusual timing indicates suspicious activity
4. **Session Analysis**: Time gaps reveal potential account takeover

#### **Implementation Details**
- **Time Difference Calculation**: `purchase_time - signup_time`
- **Hour Encoding**: Cyclical encoding for 24-hour patterns
- **Day Encoding**: Cyclical encoding for weekly patterns
- **Risk Scoring**: Exponential decay for time-based risk

### 4.2 IP Address to Country Mapping

#### **Geographic Feature Engineering**
